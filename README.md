## Join Our Project

  our bot's main attraction is the emojipasta generator, but it has since grown into a much larger project. we have an expanding list of features that involve fun, over the top meme commands, as well as general purpose server commands. we are looking for new developers to add to our team.

  right now the team consists of two active developers with a few people who only contribute when they can. our development structure up until this point has been coming up with ideas on the spot and implementing them. we are open to developers doing their own thing and contributing their own ideas, but suggestions and requests are a focus point as well.

  we are open to all skill levels as long as you're able to contribute code respective to your skill level. the bot is written in python with the discord.py module. however, we do ask that github knowledge is a must to make the collaboration easier.

  one major project in the future will be migrating the bot to discord.py v1.0 to take advantage of new features, so we will definitely need assistance with that.
